# mp3-player

Initial drop-down search framework code an mp3-player application

This template repository does not contain the mp3-player itself yet, but wires together the functionaily for an auto-suggest track search.

The search will allow standard track name search, but also enables first-letter-of-each word search for track names, similar to the search for class-name in Intellij IDEA.

For example, search for a search for 'igg' in Intellij within this project will find 'ItemGroupComparator'

Intention is to allow a similar type of search for track titles, eg. aatw would find 'All Around The World', 'Arms Around the World' etc.
